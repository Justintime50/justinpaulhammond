# justinpaulhammond.com

My personal website.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Justintime50/justinpaulhammond.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Justintime50/justinpaulhammond.com)

## Usage

```bash
# Deploy the site in prod
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy the site locally
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

## Legacy Setup

The blog used to be configured as a subfolder of this site but was moved to a subdomain for deployment purposes.
